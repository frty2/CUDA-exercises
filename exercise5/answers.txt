My kernel uses 56 registers and has a occupancy of 0,333. 
If I force the compiler to use only 32 registers, the occupancy increases to 0,5.
The kernel causes 281384 global load and 1146 global store requests. I think 
the number of accesses are low because the profiler doesnt count the cache accesses.
My code causes strong uncoalesced access to the memory, because the threads access the
same primitives and lightsources and are not offset by the threadid. 

Bonus Assigment:

I've changed the camera to face the squirrel, added 2 lightsources and added a floor of 2 triangles. The floor is so big, the the angle at the end of the surface is going down to zero. Therefor there is a gradient from white to black, which is the new background color. There are also 2 shadows caused by the squirrel on the floor.
